<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wymmCdLdPvM" title="The Uncracked Problem with 33 - Numberphile">The Uncracked Problem with 33 - Numberphile</a></b>. "33 is the lowest unsolved problem in the world of 'summing three cubes'. But 30 was also a tough nut to crack!"

This program solves equations of the form <b>n = a^3 + b^3 + c^3</b>. Basically, I wanted to confirm the difficulty stated in the video, as well as brush up on test-driven development. This is the first time I'm seeing the utility of Diophantine equations! See the video for a description of the puzzle.
